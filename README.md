If your user.js daemon is working properly, you should be able to install La Bulle by opening [this link](https://github.com/YoshiRulz/LaBulle-UserJS/raw/master/labulle.user.js), and autoupdates should also work.
If you've never used user.js before, I recommend installing [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).
